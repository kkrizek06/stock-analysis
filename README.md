**Overview of Project: **

The project had us refactor a code that runs a stock analysis. The intent is to refactor the code to a more efficient coding that runs faster. To show that our code runs faster we compare the respective run times. At first, I was unsure about the intent of the project. I didn’t expect to see such a difference in the run times. Diving into the code, I believe that I can see why the refactor code is more efficient. The original “All Sticks Analysis” consisted of a nested loop. The new “refactored” code removed this nested loop. With the nested loop, the code must run compounded. That is the choices run within choices. By removing this nested loop, the code can run through the sheet once. 

**Results:**
“All Stocks Analysis” 2017				





“All Stocks Analysis Refactored” 2017
  




“All Stocks Analysis” 2018				





“All Stocks Analysis Refactored” 2018
  

**Summary: **

**Disadvantages:** While working through this challenge, I can see 2 disadvantages to refactoring a code. The first disadvantage is that it can be easy to make a mistake or change the outcome. I can see that while the intent is to improve the code, it is possible that we change the desired outcome. This can lead to errors, where the code doesn’t run, or possibly the code will run but not with the desired intent. Another disadvantage with refactoring a code is spending time working on a functional code. A quote that I often reference is “juice worth the squeeze”. Spending time, potential too much time, refactoring a code may not be worth it. If the original code accomplishes the goal, and produces the desired outcome, why waste time improving the code? 
**Advantages:** The advantage of refactoring a code is that it can run better. This challenge impressed me with just how much better the refactored code ran. Overall, we are only talking about a second, but it was impressive how the refactored code produced the data at an instant. This can be a huge advantage if you need to apply the refactored code to more projects. 
	
**How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?** The con is that it took a lot of effort on my part to refactor the code. I struggled to achieve the goal of the challenge. Writing the original code was tough for me, but I was able to accomplish the task. The Challenge asked me to refactor this code, and I struggled to better a code that already worked. The pro is that the refactored code runs better. If we need to duplicate this code, we are duplicating a better product. Long term, knowing how to refactor a code is a perishable skill. Being able to run the code more efficiently displays a deeper understanding of the craft and will open the door for more opportunities.
